    c "Well, it is Friday, I guess. Hit me up with that."

    "Amy's pretty young, in her early twenties, I think. With her looks and positive attitude, it's no surprise she got hired." 
    "Still, she seems like the type of girl who wants to do something with her life. You know, instead of toiling her life away at some random bar in a small seaside village."

    "I'm approaching a familiar cliff with an amazing view of the ocean. Sometimes I come here in the evenings to watch the blazing sun sink under those peaceful waves."
    "I stop my bike at the cliff. From this angle, the cliff is hidden from view by the vegetation."
    "I jump over the guard rails and walk down a well-trodden path of trampled grass, arriving at the cliff."

    "The view is beautiful as usual. In front of me, the sky is red with the descending sun."
    " However, this time something is different. There is an intruder in my sanctuary. "
    " A woman in a flowing white dress is standing right at the edge of the cliff with her back turned towards me, gazing wistfully at the ever-rolling waves."

            c "Beautiful view, eh?"

            "She is startled by my sudden whisper, and before I can react in any way, her foot slips -- "
            "-- and she falls, falls, falls! I try to grasp her, but my movements are too slow."
            "In a split second, screaming, she disappears under the black waves."

            "Maybe it's better not to disturb her. I stay in the shadows of the trees, trying to keep quiet." 
            "She keeps staring at the waves, but her eyes are glazed over and empty. Just what is she thinking of...?"

            "Then, one moment, and she disappears into thin air--" 
            "That's my first impression, until I realize what has happened."

    "I was invited to her funeral, maybe because I was the only one of the locals who had gotten close to her. "
    "Still, I feel like an outsider here, among the grieving faces of her family, all of them strangers."

    "It's raining. To me, the drops seem like soft tears falling from a darkened heaven. It certainly doesn't make me feel any better."
    "After all, I am the reason she died. It was all. My. Fault."

    "As the priest is giving the funeral speech -- I can barely hear his voice as background noise to the welter of my thoughts" 
    "My gaze flits unconsciously from attendee to attendee. And slowly, slowly I realize that my eyes have fixated on someone."
    "I'm looking at someone from behind. It's a woman wearing a flowing white dress."
    "Perhaps that is what caught my attention, everyone else is wearing something suitably depressed."
    "But no, I'm looking at her long, curly hair." 
    "There's a faint voice within me, trying to tell me something, but at first I'm too lost in depression to hear."

            bq "... Do I know you, sir?"

            c "What do you mean? Of course you do..."

            "The inital shock of the crowd around me is slowly turning to annoyance, to anger, and I can feel the pressure from their silent stares."

            "The priest is slowly trying to continue his speech, unsure of what to do."

            "If Beatrice is here, at her own funeral, then who is in the coffin?"

            "I walk over to the coffin. Nobody stops me."

            "And I look at the corpse, lying quietly on the red cushions."

            "No..."

            "Beatrice slowly walks behind me, and whispers in my ear."

            b "This is not my funeral. It's yours."

        "Just keep watching...":

            "It's better not to cause a ruckus. I keep my gaze fixed on the strange apparition before me." 
            "I'm beginning to doubt my sanity. It cannot be her. This is her funeral!"

            "But then, for just a moment, she turns her head so I can see those cerulean eyes. And then I am certain. It is her."

            "All my sorrow has vanished, replaced by total confusion." 
            "It is as if the world around me was collapsing around me, crushing me under my crumbling sense of reality. What is going on?"

            "I sit and stare, unable to do anything but. The priest's words envelope me subconsciously, even though I can't pay attention to them anymore."
            "But suddenly, something he says piques my interest. It takes me a while to realize what he said." 
            "My name."

            p "Though he had only recently moved here, he was liked by all..."

            "The realization slowly dawns on me."

    "Speaking of hot, I can see Amy surfing some really big waves in the distance."
    "Unlike me, she hasn't fallen once the entire day. Her style is breathtaking."

    "If only she didn't laugh every time I fall."
    "Not that I mind making her laugh. Better than being boring."
    "Amy paddles closer to me on her board, laughing at my misery as usual. Come on girl, don't be so mean!"
    "I can't stay angry at that figure, though! Especially not with that bikini..."

    a "Hahaha, you fell again!? Hope it didn't hurt!"

    c "Eh, I can handle it."

            "The idea makes my heart pump, but all my fears are being drowned by crazy courage. I'll show her!"

            a "Okay, just wait for a reaaallly big one! Here it comes!"

            "As the wave comes, I go through the usual motions: first on my knees, then..." 
            "Stand! It feels difficult, but somehow, I manage to surf the wave."

            "With a shift of weight, I flip the board under me and jump into the air! I'm doing it!" 
            "I'm, uh, falling into the water as usual." 
            "Damn. So much for that."

            "Except the waves are really huge out here. I'm starting to wonder if this was the brightest idea."

            "Gulp. Gasp! I can't... air..."

            "The sounds of the gushing waves and Amy's shouting seem to be coming from somewhere far away as I keep sinking beneath."


        "Maybe I'll just practice a bit closer to the shore":

            "Common sense overcomes me. No way I'm ready for that."

            a "Oh, you're no fun!"

            "Amy's disappointment makes me blush and reconsider, but to be perfectly honest, I'm kinda terrified of those waves."
            "Amy paddles back into the deeps, ready to surf again."

            "Well, I guess there's nothing to do but practice. I relax for a while in the waters nearer to the shore." 
            "The sand and rocks caress the soles of my feet. It feels quite pleasant, up until I feel a strange sting." 
            "As I direct my gaze downwards, the first thing I see is this beautiful, red haze floating in the water."

            "It's my blood."

            "I panic as I look at the thing that has sunk it's teeth into my foot. A snake?... No, a moray!" 
            "I try to shake it off, but that just makes the pain worse. It's not letting go!"

            "I'm really starting to lose a lot of blood here. I desperately make my way towards the shore, but everything is getting darker around me."
            "I fall face down into the water..."
