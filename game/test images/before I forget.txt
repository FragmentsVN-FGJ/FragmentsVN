many vns don't show or have the protagonist sprite, I assume we'll have the main character visible on the scenes too? or not?
what emotions do each of the characters need?
do we need custom gui, i.e. dialogue box, main menu bg, save menu & bg, options menu & yesno panel, I probably won't have enough time for most of it
do we need CGs? i.e. special full screen image of a scene, e.g. endings or dramatic moments
do we need other characters, e.g. some side characters with only one pose?


python for adding sounds for text maybe?
init python:
    def low_beep(event, **kwargs):
        if event == "show":
            renpy.music.play("low_beep.ogg", channel="sound", loop=True)
        elif event == "slow_done" or event == "end":
            renpy.music.stop(channel="sound")

    def mid_beep(event, **kwargs):
        if event == "show":
            renpy.music.play("mid_beep.ogg", channel="sound", loop=True)
        elif event == "slow_done" or event == "end":
            renpy.music.stop(channel="sound")

    def high_beep(event, **kwargs):
        if event == "show":
            renpy.music.play("high_beep.ogg", channel="sound", loop=True)
        elif event == "slow_done" or event == "end":
            renpy.music.stop(channel="sound")

define aa = Character("Examplecharacter1", callback=mid_beep)
define bb = Character("Examplecharacter2", callback=high_beep)
define cc = Character("Examplecharacter1", callback=low_beep)
